# Industrial Genesis: The Ultimate Factory Builder
A complex, scalable, machine-focused factory simulation game built with **Godot 4.4 + C#**.

## 🎯 Core Vision
Orchestrate automated systems to manufacture a complete residential house from raw materials — no workers, just machines and pure industrial logic.

## ⚙️ Major Systems

### 🔩 Manufacturing Units
- **Primary Processors**: Turn raw ore into usable materials (smelters, refineries).
- **Assemblers**: Combine intermediate goods (e.g., aluminum + glass → windows).
- **Precision Crafters**: Make electronics and exact components.
- **Packagers**: Wrap final products for construction use.

### 🔀 Input/Output Types
- **SISO**: Single Input → Single Output (e.g., sand → glass)
- **MISO**: Multi Input → Single Output (e.g., aluminum + glass → window)
- **SIMO**: Single Input → Multi Output (e.g., oil → plastic + fuel)
- **Complex Streams**: Parallel multi-input/output processes

## 🛠 Transportation Network
- **Belts**: Basic (15/s), Fast (30/s), Express (60/s), Ultra (120/s)
- **Advanced Routing**: Splitters, mergers, underground, priority logic

## 🧪 R&D Tree
- **Logistics**: Faster, smarter belt routing
- **Manufacturing**: Efficient, multi-threaded machines
- **Materials Science**: Alloys, chemicals, composites
- **Automation**: Robotics, QC, predictive maintenance

## 🏗 Final Goal: Autonomous House Construction
Includes:
- **Structural**: Concrete, rebar, frames, shingles
- **Systems**: Wiring, plumbing, HVAC
- **Finishes**: Flooring, paint, hardware

Assembly Phases:
1. Site Prep
2. Structure
3. Systems
4. Finishing
5. Final Touches
